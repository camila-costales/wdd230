          <h2>Quito's Food</h2>
          <p>
            In Ecuadors highlands, you can find a huge diversity
             of traditional cuisine, such as soups, main dishes,
              and desserts. The traditional dishes of the highlands 
              are pork and beef-based, combined with potatoes and
               corn grains, among other things. These dishes are 
               of high quality and generally require a lot of 
               preparation time.  In Ecuadors highlands, you can find a huge diversity

          <h2>Learning Spanish</h2>
          <p>
            The biggest stumbling block for many expats 
            is the language barrier. If you didnt have Spanish 
            classes in high school or college, the idea of learning 
            a new language at age 60 or older can be a daunting thought.
