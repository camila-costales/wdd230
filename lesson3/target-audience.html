            <h2>Target Audience</h2>
            <p>My Target Audience include local businesses, residents, and visitors. The website would serve as a valuable resource for businesses, providing information and resources on how to start, grow, and market their business, and connecting them with potential partners or customers. For residents, the website would be a go-to source for information on local events, news, and community services, and a platform for engagement with their community. Visitors to Quito would also benefit from the website, which could provide them with information on local attractions, events, and businesses, helping them plan their trip and make the most of their time in the city.          </p>

            <p>The Apple website uses a typography, color, and a great layout design to show an effective an clear design with visual hierarchy. In the Picture below we can easily identify what is the most important thing and our eyes are redirected to follow a visual pace trough the hierarchy used. It is awesome how even though this part of the website is pretty simple, it is easy to scan and easy to read. Apple uses text sizes, alignment and white space to present the most important and less important things to their user.</p>
